<i>Do you miss the Jukebox of Minecraft PC? This mod is a porting of it to Minecraft Pocket Edition!</i>

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

## Features

• There are twelve different discs with twelve different songs (songs are ported from Minecraft PC).<br>
• Tap the jukebox with a disc and it will start playing the chosen song.<br>
• Greater the distance between you and the Jukebox, lower the volume of it.<br>
• Support multiple jukeboxes that play simultaneously.<br>
• There is a random chance of finding a disc every 30 kills of hostile mobs.<br>
• Tap the Jukebox to eject the disc. When the song ends the disc will be ejected automatically.<br>
• The Jukebox block and the discs are also in the creative inventory.<br>
• The crafting recipes of the Jukebox are the same of the PC version.

## F.A.Q.

*• Can I share this mod on whatever-website.com ?*<br>
Yes you can, but you have to follow the [license of this mod]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/jukebox-mod/#copyrights), this means that you have to give me credits and you can't use my work for commercial purposes (in a few words you can't make money from my work, for example you can't sell my mod).<br>

*• Can I make a YouTube review for this mod?*<br>
Of course you can. Remember that you should give me credits for this mod and if you put a link of the [minecraft-forum.net][thread] thread or the link of [the page on my website]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/jukebox-mod) it would be a lot better.<br>

*• If I found a bug, where I should report it?*<br>
The best way to report a bug is write it on the [minecraft-forum.net][thread] thread. But, before posting your bug-report, read the ["Known bugs and issues"](http://desno365.github.io/minecraft/jukebox-mod/#known-bugs-and-issues) section.

*• How can I support you?*<br>
You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/desno365), [make a donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GBEMKJBA3Z7PG), or just a "Thanks" written on the [minecraft-forum.net][thread] thread makes me happy. ;)<br>
But only the fact that someone is downloading my mod makes me glad that I made it. :)
