## Features

• There are twelve different discs with twelve different songs (songs are ported from Minecraft PC).<br>
• Tap the jukebox with a disc and it will start playing the chosen song.<br>
• Greater the distance between you and the Jukebox, lower the volume of it.<br>
• Support multiple jukeboxes that play simultaneously.<br>
• There is a random chance of finding a disc every 30 kills of hostile mobs.<br>
• Tap the Jukebox to eject the disc. When the song ends the disc will be ejected automatically.<br>
• The Jukebox block and the discs are also in the creative inventory.<br>
• The crafting recipe of the Jukebox is the same of the PC version.
