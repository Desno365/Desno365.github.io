## Information

This map and the mod attached bring the Non-Euclidean geometry on your mobile device!<br>
Experience the craziness of an unreal world, in a normal/Euclidean game like Minecraft.<br>
Words can't explain in a good way what this map has.<br>
A video explains it better: [The Unreal Geometry Map YouTube video](http://youtu.be/WwMZg0aRKIM)

Of course you can. Only one thing: if you want to add a link for the download, don't put a direct download link, but just put a link of [this web page]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/unreal-map) or a link to the [minecraftforum.net thread][thread].<br>

*• If I find a bug, where I should report it?*<br>
