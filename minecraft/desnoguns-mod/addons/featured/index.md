## Made a new addon?

So you have created an addon for the DesnoGuns Mod and you want it featured here? That's great!<br>
However there are some requirements your addon must fulfill:
• It must work without any error with the latest version of the DesnoGuns Mod.
• It must contain 3 or more guns, not less.
• You must give proper credits to the author(s) of the textures if they are not made by you.

That's all, then you can <a href="mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}" title="Send a mail to {{ site.owner.name}}" target="_blank">send me a mail</a> or [send me a message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/desno365) with the download link of your addon or with the link of the blog/website where you posted your addon.
