## How to install an addon
• An addon for the DesnoGuns Mod is like a mod with a texture pack, so it should be installed like any other MCPE mod.<br>

• Download the zip that contains the mod (addon) and the texture pack.<br>
• Extract it with your [file explorer/manager](http://play.google.com/store/search?q=file%20explorer).<br>
• Install the texture pack in BlockLauncher.<br>
• Import the script (addon) from local storage in BlockLauncher and enable it.<br>
• <b>Restart BlockLauncher</b>, if you don't restart it the addon won't be loaded.

## Creating a new addon

As soon as I have time I'll write a complete reference for creating a new addon. But for now if you're already interested in adding new guns you can look at an example addon I made for addon-developers.
Here you can download it and see how it works and maybe you can create a new one: [Example Addon for developers](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=24421527759884341)

Please note that addons are in beta stage, you may find some bugs while making them. If you find a bug report it to me so I can fix it.
