## How to install an addon

• Make sure you have installed the [DesnoGuns Mod]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/desnoguns-mod), without it addons won't work.<br>
• Download the addon (modpkg file).<br>
• Open [BlockLauncher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.mcpelauncher) and in <i>Manage ModPE scripts</i> import the modpkg file from local storage.<br>
• Restart BlockLauncher and enjoy the addon!

## Creating a new addon

As soon as I have time I'll write a complete reference for creating a new addon. But for now if you're already interested in adding new guns you can look at an example addon I made for addon-developers.<br>
Here you can download it and see how it works and maybe you can create a new one: [Example Addon for developers](http://filecred.com/A5CFG56E)

• A modpkg file is a renamed .zip file with the extension of .modpkg
