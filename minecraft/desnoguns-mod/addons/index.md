## How to install an addon

• Make sure you have installed the [DesnoGuns Mod]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/desnoguns-mod), without it addons won't work.<br>
• Download the addon you want to install (addons are modpkg files).<br>
• Open [BlockLauncher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.mcpelauncher) and in <i>Manage ModPE scripts</i> import the modpkg file from local storage.<br>
• Restart BlockLauncher and enjoy the addon!

## Creating a new addon

Instead of making a written reference that is long to read and to understand I think it's better to provide a working example of an addon with all the features you would need.<br>
You will also find comments that explain every API you can use in your addon.

• Note: a modpkg file is a renamed .zip file with the extension of .modpkg

[Example Addon for developers r003](http://filecred.com/A973G579)
