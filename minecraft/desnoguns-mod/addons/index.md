## How to install an addon
• An addon for the DesnoGuns Mod is like a mod with a texture pack, so it should be installed like any other MCPE mod.<br>
• Here it is a simple guide on how to install a mod that includes a script and a texture pack:

• Download the zip that contains the mod and the texture pack.<br>
• Extract it with your [file explorer/manager](http://play.google.com/store/search?q=file%20explorer).<br>
• Install the texture pack in BlockLauncher.<br>
• Import the script from local storage in BlockLauncher and enable it.<br>
