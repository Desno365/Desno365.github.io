## Information

Use the <b>"Companion Spawner" item in the crafting table</b> to spawn the companion.<br>
You can also use <b>/companion</b> command in chat to spawn a companion but if you are in survival mode your health will go at 0.5 half-hearts.<br>
Companions will try to follow you and when you hit a mob they will teleport near you and they will attack the mob.<br>
When one of your companions has killed some mobs he will level up and he will become more powerful!<br>
Only the level of your companions is saved when you exit the game, so you have to re-spawn them when you re-enter in the world.<br>

## Installation instructions

*• Can I add this mod in my modpack?*<br>
Yes you can, and you don't have to ask my permission, but you have to follow the [license of this mod]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/companion-mod/#copyrights), this means that you have to give me credits and you can't use my work for commercial purposes (in a few words you can't make money from my work, for example you can't sell my mod).<br>

*• Can I make a YouTube review for this mod?*<br>
Of course you can. Only one thing: if you want to add a link for the download, please, don't put a download link on MediaFire or whatever, but just put a link of [my web page]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/companion-mod) or a link of the [minecraftforum.net thread][thread].<br>

*• If I find a bug, where I should report it?*<br>
The best way to report a bug is write it on the [minecraft-forum.net][thread] thread. But, before posting your bug-report, read the ["Known bugs and issues"]({{ site.url }}/minecraft/companion-mod/#known-bugs-and-issues) section.
