We at Desno365 Games are committed to not collecting personally identifiable or sensitive information about you. However our Games and Apps do collect some <i>non-sensitive, anonymous</i> data as outlined below:


##### Data collected for Analytics
We have implemented Analytics tools to help us understand how our games or apps are being used in order to help us improve them. For example we use Unity Analytics and Google Analytics in our games to keep track of how many players have beaten each level of the game, made an in-app purchase, device type, operating system and country of access.


##### Data collected for Advertising
Since our products are free-to-play, we periodically display advertising by third parties to generate revenue. In order to display relevant advertising (also known as interest based advertising) and measure performance of advertising campaigns we have implemented several ad-network SDK within our products which collect and transfer non-sensitive device information including:

• The advertisement you have viewed and if you have engaged with it<br>
• Device make and manufacturer<br>
• Operating System<br>
• Generic geographic location, such as the city you are located in<br>
• Carrier<br>
• Language settings<br>
• IP Address<br>
• Android Advertising identifier or Apple Identifier for Advertisers<br>


##### Why collect data?
By collecting data on app usage and about your device and location, we are better able to integrate updates, implement device specific testing, explore localization opportunities and make better products that are tailored to our user's needs.
When we offer our games as free-to-play, we still require the game to generate income to help fund development costs and efforts to make the best games possible. Advertising is one way we can help cover our costs, and in order to implement relevant advertising a certain amount of non-sensitive information is required by each ad network.


##### Opt Out
By using our products you are consenting to the above collection of anonymous, non-sensitive data as outlined in this privacy policy.
If you would like to opt-out of interest based advertising or collection of data for analytics, or find out more information of any Analytics or Ad network products implemented within JOX Development games, please refer to the relevant links below (please note that individual privacy policies may be updated from time to time for any reason)
