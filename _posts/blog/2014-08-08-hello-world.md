So, this is my first website, nice ;)

It is created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on Github (everyone can look at the [source code of this site](https://github.com/Desno365/Desno365.github.io)) and I used the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/) that I really like (but I will try to personalize it more in these days).

I made it because I wanted a place where I can publish what I think and what I do.
My first idea was using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), but after 10 minutes of using it I realized that I needed something more open and clear. I search on Google and the only easy to use site was [Weebly](http://www.weebly.com/) but also that wasn't open as I want. 


So, how did you find Jekyll?

I found it by case when I was watching the [site of Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) that is created with Jekyll.


And that was the story of how this website was born.
