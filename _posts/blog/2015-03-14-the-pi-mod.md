## Information

The Pi Mod turn your device into a powerful computer that calculates in real time the Pi with a precision of 1000 digits.<br>
It actually supports up to 1e+9 (1'000'000'000) digits, but that would take a long, long, long time for every digit to be calculated, so you'll see just 1000 digits.<br>
The Pi is calculated with the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...Plouffe_formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula)

So... What this mod does?<br>
Nothing useful. It just display the Pi. ;)
