Some days ago I released my first game for mobile: Explosive Rocket.<br>
It's a result of many months of work and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I liked making it!<br>
As you can see I added a new section to my website called "games", there you can find the [support page of Explosive Rocket](/games/explosive-rocket) and in future I'll add my games in that page.<br>
And now... go and check it out!
