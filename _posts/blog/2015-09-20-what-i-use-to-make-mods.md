Since many people asked me how I make mods and what I use to make them, here is a post where I have written the software programs I currently use.<br>
Note that I use a MacBook Pro running OS X but all these softwares should also be available on Windows too, not sure about Linux.

#### Code:

I write the code of my mods on my computer, some people prefer to code them directly on a mobile device, in my opinion coding mods on a computer is 10 times faster and easier.<br>
I use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to code mods, it's a nice code editor which supports plugins too.<br>
With [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) (a plugin manager for Sublime Text) I have loaded these plugins: [GitGutter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitGutter) (to see the differences from my previous commit since I use a private Git repository for every mod), [Seti_UI](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Seti_UI) and [SideBarEnhancements](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarEnhancements).

#### Textures:

To make textures I use Adobe Photoshop CC and [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/).

#### Sounds:

With sounds the approach is different, creating sounds from nothing is difficult so what I do is use other sounds released with a free license (free license means that I have to give credits to the original authors).<br>
There are many free sounds websites but in my opinion the best are [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) and [soundbible.com](http://soundbible.com/).<br>
To modify these sounds and make them perfect as I want them, I use [WavePad](http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/index.html), this software is available on computers and on Android devices too. The Android version is pretty good too, I'll leave a link here for it: [WavePad Audio Editor on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nchsoftware.pocketwavepad_free)
