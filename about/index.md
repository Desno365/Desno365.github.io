My name is Dennis Motta, Iâ€™m 19 years old and I'm a student and a swimmer. Currently I live near Milan in Italy.

On this website I will add things that I make for fun, like mods for games or more generally things that are the result of many hours of coding.

These are the geek stuffs that I use:

- OnePlus One
- Nexus 4
- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to contact me all my public accounts are in the footer of the page, you can also follow me on Twitter so you'll get the latest news about me, my mods or whatever I do. :)
