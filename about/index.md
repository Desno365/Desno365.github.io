Hello!

My name is Dennis Motta, Iâ€™m 17 years old and I'm a student and a swimmer. I like science and technology, but I should also learn English better :D<br>
I live near Milan in Italy.

I made this website because I like computer and related things. Here I will add all of my public work (for example the mods that I'm making for Minecraft Pocket Edition).

These are the geek stuffs that I use:
{% highlight text %}
- OnePlus One
- Nexus 4
- iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2009)
{% endhighlight %}



If you want to contact me all my public accounts are in the footer of the page, you can also follow me on Twitter so you'll get the latest news about me, my mods or whatever I do. :)

<br>

> Thanks for reading!
