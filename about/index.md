Hello!

My name is Dennis I’m 17 years old and I'm a student, a swimmer and a person who likes to learn anything (I like especially Science and technology, but I should also learn English better :D ).
I live near Milan in Italy.

I made this site because I like computer and related things. Here I will add all of my public work (for example the mods that I'm making for Minecraft Pocket Edition).

These are the geek stuffs that I use:
{% highlight text %}
- Nexus 4 – Stock 4.4.4 KTU84P
- iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2009)
{% endhighlight %}



If you want you can follow me on Twitter and read my latest news, the link is in the footer of this page.

I have also a Paypal account so if you want to support me you can make a little donation.
